transposer
=====

Transposer is software that enables the musician, or non-musician to automatically transpose chords from a song to whichever key (s)/he might desire.

This is a javascript re-interpretation of an existing project that I had made a long time ago in a galaxy far away. And then later on re-implemented with my son as a co-author.
